    <ul>
        <li>I didn't have any kind of unsual technical errors. I use a lot of extensions on Virtual Studio Code to help me write more efficient code and I had no issues with anything. I was also able to finally upload my files to my web server. I used a different 3rd party SFTP client, Termius.</li>
        <li>The HTML and CSS itself was pretty easy, the most challenging thing for me was using image maps and to be honest I wasn't even aware they existed before this class.</li>
        <li>I wrote 90% of this code on my iPad with an app called "Code". It's basically a lite version of Virtual Studio Code that runs in the cloud to get around some of the development barriers Apple has on iOS. The remaining 10% I finished on my Macbook with actual Virtual Studio Code.</li>
        <li>Safari and Chrome</li>
        <li>Nothing to add</li>
    </ul>
